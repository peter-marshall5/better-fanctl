# Better fan controller for laptops

This project aims to be a better replacement for programs like nbfc, that lets you take advantage of all of your laptop's fan speeds. It uses the `acpi_ec` driver by MusiKid to communicate with the EC and a tuned PID controller in order to drastically reduce fan noise (🤫) without overheating the CPU (♨️ ).

This project is programmed in Rust (🚀), which makes it blazing fast (⚡) and cross-compatible with many platforms (🌈).
